        Hello my beautiful love. This is my official request to have the
        privilege of being your Valentine. I cannot believe it has been another
        year, another year I have gotten to spend with you. I am so grateful for
        all the time we have spent together and I am so excited for all the time
        we are yet to spend together. :)
      </p>
      <p className="loveParagraph">
        I love you so much my beautiful Levs. Mi amor. You are everything and
        anything that anyone could ever ask for. You are my best friend, and I
        am so extremely lucky to have you in my life, and even luckier to have
        the privilege of being able to call myself yours. My heart belongs to
        you and you alone, no one else can have it.
      </p>

        And now, another whole year has passed,and I am so grateful that we have
        made it this far, and even find comfort in that despite our hardship of
        not being able to see each other as much as we'd like to. I do truly
        believe that we will make it, and eventually live the life that we want
        to live together. I can't help but always feel like we were made for
        each other, and have been drawn to each other despite that hardships
        that we've faced.{" "}

      <p className="loveParagraph">
        I love you so much my beautiful girl, I am so proud of the person that
        you are. You are an incredibly beautiful person, your soul shining
        brighter than everything around it, like the flowers down below. I love
        you so so much my beautiful Baby ðŸ’–{" "}

        this was the best I could get them to look)
