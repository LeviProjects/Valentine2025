        Hello my beautiful love. This is my official request to have the
        privilege of being your Valentine. I cannot believe it has been another
        year, another year I have gotten to spend with you. I am so grateful for
        all the time we have spent together and I am so excited for all the time
        we have left to spend together. :)
      </p>
